// Package sentry integrates the exception-tracking service Sentry with
// application logging.
//
// Note that this increases the CPU and allocation cost of logging by 5-10x. If
// your application logs are already being aggregated (in Splunk,
// ElasticSearch, or something similar), consider using those tools instead.

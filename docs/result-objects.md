# Result Objects

A result object is an object with the sole purpose of carrying results
for a specific function or method.

As with [parameter objects](parameter-objects.md),
the object is defined exclusively for a single function,
and not shared with other functions.

In Fx, result objects contain exported fields exclusively,
and are always tagged with `fx.Out`.

**Related**

- [Parameter objects](parameter-objects.md) are the parameter analog of result
  objects.

## Using result objects

To use result objects in Fx, take the following steps:

1. Define a new struct type named after your constructor
   with a `Result` suffix.
   If the constructor is named `NewClient`, name the struct `ClientResult`.
   If the constructor is named `New`, name the struct `Result`.
   This naming isn't strictly necessary, but it's a good convention to follow.

   ```go mdox-exec='region ex/result-objects/define.go empty'
   type ClientResult struct {
   }
   ```

2. Embed `fx.Out` into this struct.

   ```go mdox-exec='region ex/result-objects/define.go fxout'
   type ClientResult struct {
     fx.Out
   ```

3. Use this new type as the return value of your constructor *by value*.

   ```go mdox-exec='region ex/result-objects/define.go returnresult'
   func NewClient() (ClientResult, error) {
   ```

4. Add values produced by your constructor as **exported** fields on this struct.

   ```go mdox-exec='region ex/result-objects/define.go fields'
   type ClientResult struct {
   	fx.Out

   	Client *Client
   }
   ```

5. Set these fields and return an instance of this struct from your
   constructor.

   ```go mdox-exec='region ex/result-objects/define.go produce'
   func NewClient() (ClientResult, error) {
   	client := &Client{
   		// ...
   	}
   	return ClientResult{Client: client}, nil
   }
   ```

Once you have a result object on a function,
you can use it to access other advanced features of Fx:

## Adding new results

You can add new values to an existing result object
in a completely backwards compatible manner.

1. Take an existing result object.

   ```go mdox-exec='region ex/result-objects/extend.go start'
   type Result struct {
     fx.Out

     Client *Client
   }

   func New() (Result, error) {
     client := &Client{
       // ...
     }
     return Result{
       Client: client,
     }, nil
   ```

2. Add a new field to it for your new result.

   ```go mdox-exec='region ex/result-objects/extend.go full'
   type Result struct {
   	fx.Out

   	Client    *Client
   	Inspector *Inspector
   }
   ```

3. In your constructor, set this field.

   ```go mdox-exec='region ex/result-objects/extend.go produce'
   	return Result{
   		Client:    client,
   		Inspector: &Inspector{
   			// ...
   		},
   	}, nil
   ```

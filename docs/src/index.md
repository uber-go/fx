- **Eliminate globals**

    Fx helps you remove global state from your application.
    No more `init()` or global variables.
    Use Fx-managed singletons.

- **Code reuse**

    Fx lets teams within your organization build loosely-coupled
    and well-integrated shareable components.

- **Battle-tested**

    Fx is the backbone of nearly all Go services at Uber.

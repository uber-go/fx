# Changelog

## v1.0.0-beta2 (unreleased)

* [Breaking] Remove `ulog` and expose `*zap.Logger` directly.
* [Breaking] Upgrade `zap` to `v1.0.0-rc.2` (now go.uber.org/zap, was

## v1.0.0-beta1 (20 Feb 2017)

This is the first beta release of the framework, where we invite users to start
building services on it and provide us feedback. **Warning** we are not
promising API compatibility between beta releases and the final 1.0.0 release.
In fact, we expect our beta user feedback to require some changes to the way
things work. Once we reach 1.0, we will provider proper version compatibility.
